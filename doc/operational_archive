  nsIObserver
  The nsIObserver interface is a generic notification callback interface that is typically used in conjunction with nsIObserverService.

  nsIObserverService
  The nsIObserverService interface provides methods to add, remove, notify, and enumerate observers of various notifications. 

  - how to test this API.
    in overlay, register a callback for the message.
    in preferences, send a message.
    in overlay's callback, log message to console.

    tested. It works.

  - 2012-08-03 Here is one way to do it:
    both overlay and preference window use config.js to do config file
    related actions.

    if user click reload or save, it verifies there are no errors.
    then send a NOTIFICATION to overlay.
    overlay then reload the config from disk.

  was: create a default config file on startup.

  when the two config file idea is implemented, there is no need to create a
  default config file on user's disk. The default config can be shown to the
  user, but it need not be in user's config file.

  in other words, the default user config file will be an empty file. There
  is no need to create it, unless the user want to customize.
** DONE steps
   - DONE add default config string
   - DONE use that as default config
     in init_bindings().
     parse_config_file should first parse default config string, then user's
     config file.

     DONE how to update an object like in python.
     dict.update(anotherDict)

     a = {a:1}
     b = {b:2, a:3}
   - WONT two parsing mode. first is clear and parse. second is append parse.
     this is unnecessary. parse_config_file is written in functional style.
   - DONE test that bind something to nil works.
     - DONE check for nil in nextpage's dispatch function.  command is put in
       an if, I put null value in the binding's command slot. so it will not
       execute the null command.
** DONE 2012-08-19 use two config file.
   one internal config file, one user config file.

   The internal config file need not to be a real file, it could be a fixed
   string in config.js, but the logic still holds.

   Things defined in user config file will just overwrite internal config
   file. So that if I add additional bindings or functions in the future,
   user can keep their config file and still use default enabled new
   features.

   For current case, things in internal config file could be:
   (bind "SPC" 'nextpage-maybe)
   (bind "n" 'nextpage)
   (bind "p" 'history-back)

   one example of user config file:
   (bind "SPC" nil)
   (bind "c" 'close-tab)

   I like this idea.

  config.create_config_file before calling config.write_config_file?

  No. I tested it, and found that all parent dirs will be created
  automatically. I haven't see any formal document for this, but I guess the

  show errors to user.

** DONE need to change GUI logic
   press save&load will first do a trail load, show warnings and errors to
   user. if there is no error, use it as new config, otherwise, still use old
   config. (i.e. do not send the notification)

   - API change: parse_config_file now return a third argument: success?
     - check all calls to parse_config_file. update if necessary.
** DONE bugfix: allow empty lines
** DONE parsing is full of headache without good planning.
   syntax check should be different from semantics.
   the real function call should be lazy. lazy. and lazy.
   they should never be called when checking syntax.

   move the function that
       map command used in config file to real function objects.
   to nextpage.js
   remove command_name_map, get_command_name_map()

   use nextpage.commands.runUserCommand in nextpage.js.

  the config file could be a plain file or an encoded firefox preferences

  - DONE how to get user's home dir?
    see https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Code_snippets/File_I_O
    use built-in FileUtils js module.
  - DONE how to read the file. use NetUtil module.
  - DONE how to parse the file
    parse line by line, use regexp to do toy parsing.
  - DONE provide a button to reload config file.
    which means current config should be flushed and updated.

** DONE 2012-08-02 design the thing (continued)
   - WONTFIX create a default config file on add-on init.
     if config file is found, do not overwrite it.
     To create the file, you need to create all parent dirs.

     - I used the two config design. one built-in, one user config.
       see that entry for more info.

       There is no need to create a default config file because of the
       built-in config. User can create a user config file with one click.

   - DONE add a label to show config file path.
     DONE add a button to copy config file path.

   - DONE add a button to reload config file.
   - DONE allow temperately disable a keybinding.
     by adding a text widget. (serves as a simple text editor)
     save button and reload button.

** DONE define the config file format
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; use emacs style key name.
     ;;   C-a means Ctrl-a
     ;;   M-a means Alt-a

     (bind "SPC" 'nextpage-maybe)
     (bind "n" 'nextpage)
     (bind "p" 'history-back)
   #+END_SRC

** DONE define the preferences UI
   config file: [/home/sylecn/.config/nextpage.conf] [copy]
   [a big text area here]
   [save & load] [reload only]

   when user press save & load, check the config in text area widget for
   errors. if it is good, tell user "looks good.", save it to disk, tell
   overlay to reload it. if there are some warnings, tell user, for example,
       "line 6: overwrite earlier binding (key, foobar)."
   still save and reload.
   if there are errors, tell user and do not save and reload.

   example error message:
       line X: unknown command: foo
       line Y: bind: invalid key: foo.
       line Y: bind: invalid command: foobar.

  This will call nextpage.commands.enableDebug(), which will set some of the

  nextpage.debug._debugSpecialCase = true;
  nextpage.debug._debugGotoNextPage = true;
  nextpage.debug._debugConfigFile = true;

** it's not easy.
   enable-debug need to run in the overlay thread.
   the interpreter should be moved there.
   the parser did not know what is debug and how to enable it.

   all things should be moved to nextpage.js, the config.js should only do
   syntax check.

   - enable-debug

   used a quick hack in config.js
       var in_overlay = typeof(nextpage) !== "undefined";
   then use if (in_overlay).
